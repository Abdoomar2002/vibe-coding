🧪 Stunning Technical Challenge
Objective:

Show us how you debug, build cleanly, think critically, and use AI tools (like Cursor) in your workflow — just like we do at Stunning.
________________


🔧 The Task
Using Next.js, NestJS, and MongoDB, and an AI-powered IDE (Cursor, Copilot, etc.), do the following:
1. Build a simple form in Next.js where a user enters a website idea (e.g., “Landing page for bakery”).

2. On submit, send the prompt to a NestJS API that returns 3 dummy sections (e.g., "Hero", "About", "Contact").

3. Store these sections in MongoDB.

4. Fetch the stored sections and render them as a basic preview.

5. Add loading state + basic error handling.

🧠 The data structure and how you handle logic is up to you — we care about quality and thought process.
